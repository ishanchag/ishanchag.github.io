        <p><strong>This week I have completed my first publicly viewable web design project</strong>
You can view it <a href="https://www.apexracing.uk">here</a>. This project was a test to see how easy and intuitive Google Sites was being a piece of free software. The experiment was extremely interesting and I found Google Sites to be a neat piece of software. Highlight features include: embed code feature (useful for iframes and other HTML items), branding features (auto colour schemes and handling of header and footer) and the free hosting - Google Sites hosts your website, even with a custom domain, free of charge with a few simple changes in the DNS records. I would highly recommend this for people starting out in Web Development because of how it nicely combined simplicity and flexibility all in a free web-based program.</p>
